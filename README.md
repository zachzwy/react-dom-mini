# Build your first custom React Renderer

React Renderer can be based on DOM, native VIEW and even some 2D or 3D drawing APIs.

Imaging a drawing tool using React reconciler as its core, that would be very interesting.

The unidirectional data flow pattern in React not only solves problem in frontend, but also gradually reveals its potential in solving backend problem.
